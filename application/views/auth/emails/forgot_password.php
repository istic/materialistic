Hi there!

Somebody went to <?PHP echo APPNAME ?> and told me you've forgotten your password. 

If that's not you, it means someone's trying their luck. 

Anyway, nothing's changed for now, but if you really did want to reset your 
password, please click the one-time link below and we can do something about
that.

    <?PHP echo $resetlink ?>
    

If not, just ignore this email and nothing will happen or, if you successfully
log into http://<?PHP echo APPNAME ?> right now, I'll delete that reset code and forget it
ever happened.

Either way, happy trails.

    The Management
